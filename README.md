### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is Juan Carlos. I am a mathematician living in Australia where I teach mathematics and work on the design and integration of online learning modules and interactive mathematical applets for the School of Mathematics and Physics at the University of Queensland. 

I also make open source applets about mathematics and online interactive books. They are all free and available for everyone interested in exploring mathematics from a visual point of view.

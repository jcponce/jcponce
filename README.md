### Hi there 👋

My name is Juan Carlos. 🔭 I am a mathematician working on the design and integration of online learning modules, free interactive [mathematical applets](https://jcponce.github.io/) and [books](https://complex-analysis.com/).

![](<img src="penrose-triangle.gif" width="10%" />) I also share animations about mathematics and physics on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jcponcemath) and appreciate ❤️ your [support](https://www.patreon.com/jcponce). Thanks 😄.

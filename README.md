### Hi there 👋

My name is Juan Carlos. 🔭 I am a mathematician working on the design and integration of online learning modules, [interactive mathematical applets](https://jcponce.github.io/) and [online interactive books](https://complex-analysis.com/) 📘.

I share animations about mathematics and physics on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jcponcemath).
